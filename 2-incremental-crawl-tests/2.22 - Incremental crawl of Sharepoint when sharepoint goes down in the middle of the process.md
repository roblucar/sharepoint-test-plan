# 2.22 - Incremental crawl of Sharepoint when sharepoint goes down in the middle of the process

## summary 

During an incremental crawl of Sharepoint, the Sharepoint farm becomes un-reachable for a long period of time. The crawl job should end gracefully after some time. Verify that no indexed documents are deleted as a result of the Sharepoint outage

## steps 1

  * Create a web application and site collection sc1 on sharepoint farm f1 though the central admin console
  * Create a web application and site collection sc2 on sharepoint farm f2 though the central admin console
  * Populate sc1 with site s1
  * Populate sc2 with site s2
  * Populate sites s1, s2 with lists l1 amd l2
  * Populate lists l1, l2 with list items
  * Configure datasource with "fetch failure allowance =1" to allow deletion from index on recrawl
  * Crawl sc1, sc2 using same datasource
  
## assertion 1 

  * Verify that site collection sc1 and sc2 and its contents are crawled and indexed

## steps 2

  * Pause the server hosting the Sharepoint farm f1 so it doen not respond to requests
  * Crawl sc1, sc2 using same datasource

## assertion 2

  * Verify that the crawl completes and none of the indexed documents that correspond to sc1 are removed
